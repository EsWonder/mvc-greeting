# 🧩 MVC - Model View Controller Architecture Example

This project demonstrates a basic **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture pattern using **Node.js**. The purpose is to show a clear separation of concerns in a simple application.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Model** (`user.js`) stores or retrieves the data.
- **View** (`render.js`) handles how the information is displayed.
- **Controller** (`userController.js`) acts as a bridge between model and view.
- **app.js** runs the application and connects everything.

## ▶️ Run the App
Open a terminal in the project root and run:
```bash
node app.js
```

Expected output:

```bash
Bienvenido, Sebastian!

```
